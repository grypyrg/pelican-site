title: Open Source Monitoring with Icinga

 # Abstract
Most sys admins have a love-hate relationship with Icinga/Nagios based
monitoring solutions. Utilitarian and backed by a sizable community, users have
learned to live with shortcomings in scaling, configuration and integration with
tools common to modern architecture.

After tiring of fiddly hacks and convoluted configs, the Icinga team
decided to build a new, accessible and flexible core. Icinga 2 was born –
infinitely and easily scalable, even as a cluster-ready solution, with load
balancing, automated replication and business process monitoring out of the box.

This talk will present Icinga 2’s innovative multi-threaded architecture and
explain how it allows countless clusters of monitoring instances to run at
speeds as yet unseen, all while minimizing maintenance. It will demonstrate how
popular tools such as Graphite, Logstash and Puppet integrate better and
easier than ever before. In addition to that we’ll introduce the new Icinga Web
2 interface and give a brief introduction into the technical architecture. A
live demo will follow and well as a look into development plans to come.
