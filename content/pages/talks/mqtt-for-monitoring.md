title: MQTT for monitoring (and for the IoT)
slug: mqtt_monitoring
status: hidden
category: proposals

# Abstract

MQTT is a PUB/SUB protocol for the Internet of Things, but it's also
valuable for systems administration. We'll take a close look
at MQTT and its infrastructure, and we'll show you how to
use a microcontroller to monitor your server-room's temperature
with it, publishing and monitoring it via MQTT and Icinga/Nagios.
