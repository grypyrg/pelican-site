# Abstract

[OpenHAB](http://www.openhab.org) is a vendor and technology-agnostic Open Source
automation software for your home (or office!). In this talk we introduce OpenHAB
and show you how to get started with some blinkenlights and things. (Just before
this talk, we'll introduce MQTT in a previous separate talk; we strongly recommend
you see that as well! :-)
