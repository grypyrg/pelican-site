title: Containers with systemd-nspawn
status: hidden
category: proposals

# Abstract

While probably the most prominent, Docker is not the only tool for building
and managing containers. Originally meant to be a "chroot on steroids" to
help debug systemd, systemd-nspawn provides a fairly uncomplicated approach
to work with containers. Being part of systemd, it is available on most
recent distributions out-of-the-box and requires no additional dependencies.

This talk will introduce the concepts involved in containers and will guide
you through the steps of building a container from scratch. The payload
will be a simple service, which will be activated when the first connection
request arrives.
