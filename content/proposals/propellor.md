title: Propellor: host configuration management in Haskell
status: hidden
category: proposals

 # Abstract
Propellor is a declarative host configuration management system by Joey Hess.
Each system has a set of of properties, which propellor makes sure are
satisfied.
The configuration is written in Haskell, and propagated to machines using git.

This talk will introduce the concepts used in propellor and show
some basic usage.

Propellor being written in Haskell makes it very flexible,
but you do not have to be a Haskell expert to use it.
